# Applied Machine Learning Project: TurboFan Engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
This is the repository of the machine learning project developed for the "Applied Machine Learning" Course @ SDU - University of Southern Denmark

## Introduction
With technological advancements, the complexity of turbofan engines has increased significantly,
making effective maintenance strategies crucial. About 60% of aircraft breakdowns involve turbofan engines,
influenced by varying operating hours and conditions. Traditional maintenance methods, such as corrective and preventive maintenance, are inadequate for ensuring optimal performance and reliability. This
study explores Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) techniques, focusing on the prediction of the
Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines using data-driven approaches.

## Project Overview
The paper shows a variety of machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Random Forests Regression, Support Vector Machines Regression, and Neural Networks, to analyze
historical sensor data and predict engine degradation. The results indicate that ensemble methods like
Random Forests and advanced models such as Support Vector Machine Regression with RBF kernel provide
superior performance compared to simpler models, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness in RUL
prediction.
The findings suggest that these data-driven models can significantly enhance the reliability of maintenance strategies for turbofan engines.
